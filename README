Maven port of yajsw.

Official page: http://sf.net/projects/yajsw

It should now install Abeille Forms and ahessian from the GitHub pages-hosted Maven repository on the gh-pages branch. No user-intervention required hopefully.

The yajsw-core:distribution artifact contains all the core code and dependencies in one uberjar.

The yajsw-base artifact just contains the core code, and the yajsw-base-deps artifact refers to all the dependencies.

The yajsw-parent artifact builds everything.
