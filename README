Maven port of yajsw.

Official page: http://sf.net/projects/yajsw

It should now install Abeille Forms and ahessian from the GitHub pages-hosted Maven repository on the gh-pages branch. No user-intervention required hopefully.

The yajsw-core:distribution artifact contains all the core code and dependencies in one uberjar.

The yajsw-base artifact just contains the core code, and the yajsw-base-deps artifact refers to all the dependencies.

The yajsw-parent artifact builds everything.

There is some additional code to allow config autogeneration via an API, and loading resources directly from the jar. Hopefully at some point this will be wrapped in a Maven plugin.
